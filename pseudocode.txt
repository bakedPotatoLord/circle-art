GOALS:

expand until wall
expand till smallest circle
expand until overlap

Procedure:
set r to wallDist
if inside a circle:
    find smallest circle
    if smallestCircle is smaller than r,:
        set smallestCircle to r

if overlapping a circle and not inside of it:
    find maxwithoutOverlap
    set r to maxwithoutOverlap
